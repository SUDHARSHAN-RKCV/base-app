# 🚀 Base App Templates Repository

A curated collection of secure, stable, production-ready base templates for multiple tech stacks.

This repository provides foundational application structures that developers can extend with features — without worrying about architecture, security hygiene, or deployment fundamentals.

🎯 Purpose

Building applications from scratch often leads to:

Inconsistent structure

Poor security practices

Missing production configurations

Fragile deployment setups

This repository solves that by offering:

🔐 Secure-by-default
🧱 Structured architecture
⚙️ Production-ready configurations
📦 Minimal yet extensible foundations

🏗 What This Repository Contains

Each template includes:

Clean project structure

Environment-based configuration

Secure dependency management

Production-ready server configuration

Logging setup

Health check endpoints

Authentication scaffolding (where applicable)

Example .env file

Pre-configured .gitignore

Dependency pinning

Security scan compatibility (Snyk / Dependabot)

🧩 Supported Tech Stacks
🐍 Python

Flask (Gunicorn + Nginx ready)

FastAPI (ASGI production-ready)

Django (Secure base config)

🟢 Node.js

Express.js

NestJS

🦀 Rust

Actix Web

Axum

⚛️ Frontend

React (Vite)

Next.js

Static SPA template

🔄 CI / CD Integration

This repository is designed to integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.

✅ Continuous Integration

Each template supports:

Dependency installation validation

Linting

Basic security scanning

Test execution

Build verification

Example GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml):

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r python/flask-base/requirements.txt

      - name: Run security scan
        run: |
          pip install snyk
          snyk test || true
```

🚀 Continuous Deployment (Optional Extensions)

Templates are structured to support:

Docker builds

Deployment to:

AWS EC2

Azure App Services

DigitalOcean

Self-hosted VPS (Gunicorn + Nginx)

Systemd-based deployments

Container-based deployments (Kubernetes-ready base structure)

Example deployment flow:

Push to main

CI runs tests + security scan

Docker image builds

Image pushed to registry

Server pulls latest image

Zero-downtime restart

🛡 Security Integration

This repository is compatible with:

✅ GitHub Dependabot

✅ Snyk Security Scans

✅ Pinned Dependencies

✅ Environment-based secret management

Security is treated as a baseline requirement, not an add-on.
